**Machine learning** has transformed how we approach problem solving in computer science. Traditional algorithms require *explicit programming* of every step, but machine learning systems can learn patterns from data.

This **paradigm shift** enables applications that were previously impossible. Consider image recognition, natural language processing, and recommendation systems. These technologies now power everything from *smartphones* to *autonomous vehicles*.

The field continues to evolve rapidly with new architectures and techniques emerging constantly.
